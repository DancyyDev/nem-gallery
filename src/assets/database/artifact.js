      "Step into the world of Michael Faraday, a brilliant scientist from the 19th century whose discoveries changed the way we understand electricity and magnetism.",

      "Imagine a time when people were just beginning to unlock the secrets of electricity. Faraday conducted a groundbreaking experiment in 1831 that showed how electricity and magnetism are connected. He discovered that when a magnet moves near a wire, it creates an electric current. This discovery laid the foundation for the modern technology we use today.",

      "When Michael Faraday made his discovery of electromagnetic induction, he hypothesized that a changing magnetic field is necessary to induce a current in a nearby circuit. To test his hypothesis he made a coil by wrapping a paper cylinder with wire.  Gently tilt the tube so the magnet slides down the tube and see if you can generate a tiny electric current.",

      "The strength of an electromagnet depends on the number of windings in the coil and the strength of the electric current. More windings and stronger current produce more intense magnetic fields.",

    impact:
      "Faraday's experiment was a crucial step in understanding the relationship between electricity and magnetism. This breakthrough led to the development of generators, which produce the electricity that powers our homes, schools, and gadgets. Without Faraday's discoveries, many of the electronic devices we rely on today might not exist.",

Magnetic flux is a measure of the magnitude of a magnetic field passing through a given area.",

When you flip the switch the other way, the compass needles reverse because the direction of the current has been reversed.",

It takes the negatively charged electrons away from the copper plate, leaving the positive charges behind. It then gives electrons to the aluminum plate, causing it to become negatively charged. These electrons pass through the meter as they return to the copper plate. In a simple circuit like this, the direction of current flow is determined by the potential difference between the two plates. When you touch both plates simultaneously, you complete the circuit, allowing the flow of electrons from the higher potential (copper plate) to the lower potential (aluminum plate) through your body."
